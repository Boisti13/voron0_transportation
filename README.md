# voron0_transportation

This macro moves the printer to a predefined position to mount transportation brackets securely and saves the transport state. 
It also provides visual feedback using LEDs/Neopixels and ensures the printer is safe for transport. 
A separate macro resets the transport mode after removing the brackets, restoring the printer to normal operation. 
Additional checks and menu entries allow easy management of transport mode via the printer's LCD.
